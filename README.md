Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The Boston Housing dataset is used for training and evaluation
Introduction
Housing price prediction is a critical task in real estate analytics, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions about property investments and pricing strategies. This project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be used to predict housing prices with features such as:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate.
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
LSTAT: Percentage of lower status population.
DIS: Weighted distances to employment centers, and more.
The project visualizes the relationships between features and the target variable and evaluates the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Dataset Description
The Boston Housing dataset contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in Boston, Massachusetts. It includes:

13 features describing socio-economic and physical factors of neighborhoods.
Target variable: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
Note: Due to licensing issues, the dataset may not be available in future releases of sklearn. For alternate sources, download it from trusted repositories or use similar datasets like California Housing.
